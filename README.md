## Bloc Frontend Project Starter



A starter application for student projects in Bloc's [Frontend Web Development Course](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp).

## Configuration

We started this project by first refactoring our bloc-jams project. This project uses JS, Angular, HTML/CSS, and the Buzz API to handle mp3 files.

## Run the Application

Run the application using the Gruntfile's `default` task:

```
$ grunt
```

The default task runs a simple server on port 3000. To view it in a any browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

>Note that unless the application is run [via Live Preview in Brackets](#use-in-brackets-live-preview), the browser will need to be refreshed to view the most recent changes.

### Using without Angular

By default, the application is configured to be used in a Single-Page Application (SPA) with AngularJS. If you're working on a project that doesn't use AngularJS, see the instructions below [for configuring the server to run in a non-SPA](#configure-server-for-non-spas).

## Directory Structure

```
├── Gruntfile.js
├── LICENSE
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── app
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── images
│   │       └── bloc-logo-white.png

└── server.js
```

All code, styles, markup, and assets should be saved to the `app` directory. Saving changes creates a new directory, `dist`, that holds final copies of the application content. `dist` is the directory the server uses to serve the content displayed by the browser. __Do not edit files in `dist`__ because it will reset changes to your work every time you save. Restrict all edits to files in the `app` directory.

### Assets/Images

Add images to the `app/assets/images` directory. To reference images in HTML, use the path `/assets/images/<image file name>.jpg`. For example, to include the image called `bloc-white-logo.png`, the path for the `src` attribute in the HTML would be:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/bloc-white-logo.png">
```

__Note:__ A sample image has been added to `app/images`. To remove the image from the application, run the following command from the root of repo:

```bash
$ rm -f app/assets/images/bloc-white-logo.png
```

To reference any other assets, like the music in Bloc Jams, use the path `assets/<asset-type>/<asset-file>`. The Gruntfile is pre-configured to handle assets in a subfolder with the `.mp3` extension.

>See lines 14 and 35 of `Gruntfile.js` for the accepted file extensions of assets.

### Difference between Pages and Templates

The `templates` directory should hold any HTML files used as templates in Angular states configured by UI Router. All other HTML files belong in the `pages` directory.
